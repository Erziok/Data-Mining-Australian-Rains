# Data-Mining-Australian-Rains
This project is about the Australian continent, which is considered the driest and flattest continent on the planet. Studies have been requested on the climatic characterisics of this continent, based on the different regions it has. In order to be able to make accurate predictions about whether it will rain in the future.

We have been provided with a dataset, which contains data on daily weather observations for multiple locations in Australia, this has been obtained from the Australian Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology. The data has been processed to provide the objective variable **RainTomorrow** (if there is rain for the next day) and risk variable **RISK_MM** (how much rain has been recorded in milimeters)
